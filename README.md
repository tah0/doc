# xps15

Forked from rcasero's repo [for miscellaneous notes and documentation](https://github.com/rcasero/doc/wiki), specifically for the wiki page on setting up Ubuntu on a Dell XPS 15. I used his instructions as a general guide for setting up my own XPS, and I change/add to [the wiki to track my setup](https://github.com/tah0/xps15/wiki/Ubuntu-linux-on-Dell-XPS-15-(9560)).

The only file for now is this `README.md`.
